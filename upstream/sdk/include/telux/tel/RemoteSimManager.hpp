/**
 * @file       RemoteSimManager.hpp
 * @brief      Remote SIM Manager is a primary interface for remote card operations.
 *             This allows a device to use a SIM card on another device for its WWAN
 *             modem functionality. The SIM provider service is the endpoint that
 *             interfaces with the SIM card (e.g. over bluetooth) and sends/receives
 *             data to the other endpoint, the modem. The modem sends requests to the
 *             SIM provider service to interact with the SIM card (e.g. power up,
 *             transmit APDU, etc.), and is notified of events (e.g. card errors,
 *             resets, etc.). This API is used by the SIM provider endpoint to provide
 *             a SIM card to the modem.
