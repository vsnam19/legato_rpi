    This API can be used for the registeration of both Tx and Rx. It sets up sockets
    on the requested port numbers. A negative port number corresponds to no actions
    for Tx or Rx.

    @par
    Wildcard is used to receive all traffic. Only one port can be registered as
    wildcard port. Once wildcard is registered successfully, all received packets
    will be directed to wildcard port, and any subscription for specific service
    IDs or catchall port at other ports will be invalid. The parameter rx_id_list
    of this API should be set to a null list for wildcard subscription.
    @par
    Catchall port is used to receive packets with non-registered service IDs
    (via specific service IDs subscription). Only one port can be registered
    as catchall port. If catchall port is registered successfully, received
    packets with non-registered service ID will be directed to catchall port.
    All specific service IDs subscription (if any) should be performed before
    catchall port subscription. The parameter rx_id_list of this API should
    include all non-registered service IDs for catchall port subscription.
    @par
    Any port different from catchall port can be used to receive packets with specific
    service IDs. Only one port can be registered for a single service ID, a list of
    service IDs can be registered at a single port. To subscribe specific service IDs
    at a given Rx port, a Tx flow should also be set up using this API. The parameter
    rx_id_list should include all interested service IDs for the given Rx port, the
    parameter tx_flow_info.reservation.v2xid should be set to one of the service ID
    included in rx_id_list, the parmenter tx_sps_portnum or tx_event_portnum should
    be set to the same port number as rx_portnum.
