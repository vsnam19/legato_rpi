 *             The Manager is used to provide config items for flow and calculations of
 *             Congestion Control. It provides inputs and outputs that are part of
 *             various parts of congestion control such as tracking error, inter-transmit time,
 *             packet error rate, density, and others. Outputs are provided to the user to notify
 *             when to send and change other related congestion control settings.
