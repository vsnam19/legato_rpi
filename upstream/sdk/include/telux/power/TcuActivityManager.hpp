/**
 * @brief   ITcuActivityManager provides interface to register and de-register listeners to get
 *          TCU-activity state updates. And also API to initiate TCU-activity state transition.
 *
 * An application can get the appropriate TCU-activity manager (i.e. @ref ClientType::SLAVE or
 * @ref ClientType::MASTER) object from the power factory. The TCU-activity manager configured as
 * the @ref ClientType::MASTER is responsible for triggering state transitions. TCU-activity manager
 * configured as a @ref ClientType::SLAVE is responsible for listening to state change indications
 * and acknowledging when it performs necessary tasks and prepares for the state transition. A
 * machine in this power management framework represents an application processor subsystem or a
 * host/guest virtual machine on hypervisor based platforms.
 *
 * - Only one @ref ClientType::MASTER is allowed in the system. This master can exist only on
 *   the primary/host machine and not on the guest virtual machine or an external application
 *   processor (EAP).
 * - It is expected that all processes interested in a TCU-activity state change should register as
 *   @ref ClientType::SLAVE.
 * - When the @ref ClientType::MASTER changes the TCU-activate state, @ref ClientType::SLAVEs
 *   connected to the impacted machine are notified.
 * - @ref ClientType::MASTER can trigger the TCU-activity state change of a specific machine or all
 *   machines at once.
 * - If the @ref ClientType::SLAVE wants to differentiate between a state change indication that is
 *   the result of a trigger for all machines or a trigger for its specific machines, it can be
 *   detected using the machine name provided in the listener API.
 * - When the @ref ClientType::MASTER triggers an all machines TCU-activity state change, only the
 *   machines that are not in the desired state will undergo the state transition, and the
 *   @ref ClientType::SLAVEs to those machines will be notified.
 * - In the case of
 *   - @ref TcuActivityState::SUSPEND or @ref TcuActivityState::SHUTDOWN trigger:
 *      - After becoming ready for state change, all @ref ClientType::SLAVE should acknowledge back.
 *      - The @ref ClientType::MASTER will get notification about the consolidated acknowledgement
 *        status of all @ref ClientType::SLAVEs.
 *      - On getting a successful consolidated acknowledgement from all the @ref ClientType::SLAVE
 *        for the suspend trigger, the power framework allows the respective machine to suspend. On
 *        getting a successful consolidated acknowledgement from all the @ref ClientType::SLAVEs for
 *        the shutdown trigger, the power framework triggers the respective machine shutdown without
 *        waiting further.
 *      - If the @ref ClientType::SLAVE sends a NACK to indicate that it is not ready for state
 *        transition or fails to acknowledge before the configured time, then the
 *        @ref ClientType::MASTER will get to know via a consolidated/slave acknowledgement status
 *        notification.
 *      - In such failed cases, if the @ref ClientType::MASTER wants to stop the state transition
 *        considering the information in the consolidated acknowledgement, then the
 *        @ref ClientType::MASTER is allowed to trigger a new TCU-activity state change, or else the
 *        state transition will proceed after the configured timeout.
 *   - @ref TcuActivityState::RESUME trigger:
 *      - Power framework will prevent the respective machine from going into suspend.
 *      - No acknowledgement will be required from @ref ClientType::SLAVE and the
 *        @ref ClientType::MASTER will not be getting consolidated/slave acknowledgement as machine
 *        will be already resumed.
 *
 * When the application is notified about the service being unavailable, the TCU-activity state
 * notifications will be inactive. After the service becomes available, the existing listener
 * registrations will be maintained.
