/**
 * A physical slot refers to the actual hardware slot available on a device.
 *
 * A logical slot refers to the logical modem stack that is mapped to a physical slot.
 *
 * For multi-SIM configurations like DSDA and DSDS,
 * where two logical modem stacks require two SIMs, there is a 1:1 mapping between
 * logical and physical slots.
 *
 * Device configurations like DSSS/DSSA have a single logical
 * modem stack and multiple physical slots. In this case,
 * it may be necessary to map the logical slot to one of the physical slots. This can be achieved
 * using @ref telux::tel::IMultiSimManager::switchActiveSlot.
 *
 * Most of the APIs use the logical slot ID. When an API requires
 * the physical slot ID (for example, @ref telux::tel::IMultiSimManager::switchActiveSlot),
 * the documentation for those
 * APIs will explicitly mention this.
