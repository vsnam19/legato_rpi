 * @file       DualDataManager.hpp
 *
 * @brief      The DualDataManager class provides APIs to manage dual data
 *             connectivity. For example, you can use the DualDataManager class to:
 *             - Check the dual data capability of the device.
 *             - Check the dual data usage recommendation.
 *             - Perform DDS switch
 *             - Request current DDS SIM slot
 *             - Request recommended DDS SIM slot
 *             - Register for listener APIs to be notified about dual data changes
 *               (capability, usage recommendation, DDS recommendation).
 * Key points:
 * Dual SIM Dual Active (DSDA): In this case, both SIMs can operate independently. There are two
 *          radio resources available, allowing the SIMs to work independently. For example, a voice
 *          call can be made on SIM slot 1, and a data call can be made on SIM slot 2. Additionally,
 *          data calls can be started on both SIM slots.
 *
 * Dual SIM Dual Standby (DSDS): In this case, only one radio resource is available for use, which
 *          is time-shared between the SIMs. Both SIM slots use the same frequency band to transmit
 *          data, achieving maximum throughput. Voice calls can be received on either SIM, but
 *          long-running data calls cannot be started on both SIM slots simultaneously.
 *
 * Default Data Subscription (DDS): When the device is in DSDS mode or switches from DSDA to DSDS,
 *          long-running data calls are expected to run on the DDS SIM slot only. In scenarios like
 *          a voice call on the non-DDS SIM, the data call should temporarily switch to the non-DDS
 *          SIM to avoid loss of data service.
