 *  - If this is first client to start datacall in the system and no error is detected,
 *    getDataCallStatus() of @ref telux::data::IDataCall object will return NET_CONNECTING and
 *    onDataCallInfoChanged will be called once data call is brought up successfully or failed.
 *  - If client tries to start data call that is already up and no error is detected,
 *    getDataCallStatus() of @ref telux::data::IDataCall object will return NET_CONNECTED and
 *    onDataCallInfoChanged will not get called.
 *  - If any client start data call and error is detected, error argument will contain error
 *    code and onDataCallInfoChanged will not get called.

 * When callback is used with stopDataCall, expected behavior is as following:
 *  - First/Last client that attempts to stop data call and no error is detected,
 *    getDataCallStatus() of @ref telux::data::IDataCall object will return NET_DISCONNECTING and
 *    onDataCallInfoChanged will be called once data call is down.
 *  - If a client attempt to stop data call it started earlier while same data call is started by
 *    other clients in the system, and no error is detected, getDataCallStatus() of
 *    @ref telux::data::IDataCall object will return NET_CONNECTED and onDataCallInfoChanged will
 *    not get called.
 *  - If any client attemp to stop data call and error detected, error argument will contain error
 *    code and onDataCallInfoChanged will not get called.
 *  - If the client tries to start a data call on specific profile id and network interface name and:
*       - If data call already exists with the same profile ID but a different network interface
 *        then error will be set to telux::ErrorCode::DEVICE_IN_USE and onDataCallInfoChanged
 *        will not get called.
 *      - If data call already exists with the same network interface but different profile ID then
 *        error will be set to telux::ErrorCode::INVALID_OPERATION and onDataCallInfoChanged will
 *        not get called.
 *      - Another client has already requested to tear down an existing data call with
 *        the same profile ID and network interface name and this operation is in progress, an
 *        telux::ErrorCode::OP_IN_PROGRESS error occurs and onDataCallInfoChanged will not be
 *        called.
 *  - On platforms where a client is not allowed to specify the name of the network interface
 *    name when starting a data call, the callback will be invoked with error
 *    telux::ErrorCode::REQUEST_NOT_SUPPORTED and onDataCallInfoChanged will not be called.
 *
 *  Note: Telsdk broadcasts changes in any data call status to all available clients through the
 *        listener interface telux::data::IDataConnectionListener::onDataCallInfoChanged.
 *        Therefore, clients could get notification about data calls and their status changes that
 *        might not be relevent to the client. Client could also get successful connection
 *        notifications of data call client previously failed to connect.
 *        The notification could be a consequence of another client activity or system is set to
 *        automatically reconnect failed data calls.
