 * Port Configuration
 *
 * @ref PortConfig::port -  Port number. If range is non-zero, this is the starting port number;
 * otherwise, it is a single port number.

 *
 * @ref PortConfig::maxActiveConnections - Optional field, applicable for QoS filter. This
 * indicates the maximum number of active connections possible at the same time in the given source
 * port range, considering all traffic sources - in apps processor or tethered client. This is
 * applicable when multiple traffic sources:
 *  1. send data in the UL direction over the cellular connection
 *  2. use the same data call (use the same public IP)
 *  3. have the same source port range
 *
 *  If the maximum active connections are less than the range provided, then by default, the
 *  range will be considered the maximum active connections.
 *  Some examples below consider multiple clients' traffic sources satisfying the above conditions.
 *
