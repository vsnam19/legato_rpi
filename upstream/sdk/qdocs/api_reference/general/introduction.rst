Introduction
============

Purpose
-------
The Telematics software development kit (TelSDK) is a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) 
that provide access to the QTI-specific hardware and software capabilities.

This document is intended to act as a reference guide for developers by providing details of the TelSDK 
APIs, function call flows and overview of TelSDK architecture.

Scope
-----
This document focusses on providing details of the TelSDK APIs. It assumes that the developer is familiar 
with Linux and C++11 programming.

Conventions
-----------
Function declarations, function names, type declarations, and code samples appear in a different font. 

For example,

``#include``

Parameter directions are indicated as follows:

.. code-block:: cpp 
   
   [in]      paramname  Indicates an input parameter.
   [out]     paramname  Indicates an output parameter.
   [in,out]  paramname  Indicates a parameter used for both input and output.

Most APIs are asynchronous as underlying sub-systems such as telephony are asynchronous. API names follow 
the convention of using prefix " get " for synchronous calls and " request " for asynchronous calls. 
Asynchronous responses such as listener callbacks come on a different thread than the application thread.

SDK Versioning
--------------

The following convention is used for versioning the SDK releases

**SDK version (major.minor.patch)**

SDK_VERSION = 1.0.0

- **Major version** -- This number will be incremented whenever significant changes or features are introduced.
- **Minor version** -- This number will be incremented when smaller features with some new APIs are introduced.
- **Patch version** -- If the release only contains bug fixes, but no API change then the patch version would be incremented, No change in the actual API interface. 

.. note::
    Use telux::common::Version::getSdkVersion() API to query the current version of SDK or refer the VERSION 
    file in the repository

Public API Status
-----------------

Public APIs are introduced and removed (if necessary) in phases. This allows users of an existing API that is being 
Deprecated to migrate. APIs will be marked with note indicating whether the API is subject to change or if it is not 
recommended to use the API as follows:

- **Eval** -- This is a new API and is being evaluated. It is subject to change and could break backwards compatibility.
- **Obsolete** -- API is not preferred and a better alternative is available.
- **Deprecated** -- API is not going to be supported in future releases. Clients should stop using this API. Once an API has been marked as Deprecated, the API could be removed in future releases.
