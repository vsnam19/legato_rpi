Audio SDK provides details of supported "Device Types" and "Stream Types" in the audio subsystem of Reference Telematics platform.

“Device Type” encapsulates the type of device supported in Reference Telematics platform.
The representation of these devices would be made available via public header file <usr/include/telux/audio/AudioDefines.hpp>.

Example: DEVICE_TYPE_XXXX

Internally SDK DeviceTypes are mapped to Audio HAL devices as per <usr/include/system/audio.h>.

In current release it is mapped per below table.

**Current Device Mapping Table:**

.. csv-table::
   :header: "SDK Audio Device Representation", "Audio HAL Representation"
   :widths: 50, 50 
   
   "DEVICE_TYPE_SPEAKER", "AUDIO_DEVICE_OUT_SPEAKER"
   "DEVICE_TYPE_MIC", "AUDIO_DEVICE_IN_BACK_MIC" 

However Device Mapping is configurable as stated below. This configurability provides flexibility to map different Audio HAL devices
to SDK representation.

Update tel.conf file with below details before boot of system.

- NUM_DEVICES -- Specifies the number of device types supported
- DEVICE_TYPE -- Specifies the SDK type of each device (in comma separated values)
- DEVICE_DIR -- Specifies the device direction for each device in order above (in comma separated values)
- AHAL_DEVICE_TYPE -- Specifies the mapped Audio HAL type of each device (in comma separated values)

Example:

.. note::
   The default values provided here are based on QTI's reference design.

.. code-block:: text 
   
   NUM_DEVICES=6
   
   DEVICE_TYPE=1,2,3,257,258,259

   DEVICE_DIR=1,1,1,2,2,2

   AHAL_DEVICE_TYPE=2,1,4,2147483776,2147483652,2147483664

For any stream types, maximum device supported would be one. Single stream per multiple devices not supported.
For voice stream Rx Device would decide corresponding Tx Device pair as decided by Audio HAL.

**NOTE FOR SYSTEM INTEGRATORS:**

The mapping of Audio devices to Audio HAL devices is static currently based on QTI's Reference Telematics platform.
For custom platforms this mapping need to be updated.

“Stream Type” encapsulates the type of stream supported in Reference Telematics Platform.
The representation of these stream types made available via public header file <usr/include/telux/audio/AudioDefines.hpp>.

Example:  VOICE_CALL, PLAY, CAPTURE, LOOPBACK, TONE_GENERATOR etc

**Volume Support Table:**

This table captures scenarios where the volume could be modified.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Stream Type", "Stream Direction (RX)", "Stream Direction (Tx)"
   :widths: 26, 36, 36 
   
   "VOICE_CALL", "Applicable", "Not Applicable"
   "PLAY","Applicable", "Not Applicable" 
   "CAPTURE", "Not Applicable", "Applicable"
   "LOOPBACK", "Not Applicable", "Not Applicable" 
   "TONE_GENERATOR", "Not Applicable", "Not Applicable" 

In case QTI's reference design does not support volume for specific stream category, API responds with error.

**Mute Support Table:**

This table captures when stream could be muted and in which direction.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Stream Type", "Stream Direction (RX)", "Stream Direction (Tx)"
   :widths: 26, 36, 36

   "VOICE_CALL", "Applicable", "Applicable"
   "PLAY", "Applicable", "Not Applicable"
   "CAPTURE", "Not Applicable", "Applicable"
   "LOOPBACK", "Not Applicable", "Not Applicable"
   "TONE_GENERATOR", "Not Applicable", "Not Applicable"

In case QTI's reference design does not support mute for specific stream category, API responds with error.

.. note::
   If mute operations is performed for  play or capture stream direction(Tx or RX), the stream will get muted irrespective of the direction provided.

   **Data SSR and Recovery**


Security
--------

SELinux
~~~~~~~
SELinux is an access control framework provided by the Linux kernel. It provides a mechanism to restrict/control access to system resources such as file nodes and sockets. SELinux framework expects any process running in userspace to declare all its interactions with the system resources in the form of SELinux policies. On platforms enabled with SELinux, an app that uses an SDK API would also need to declare its usage through SELinux policies to ensure that it has all the required permissions.

Listed below are the SELinux Interfaces which are generic for any API in particular namespace that app needs to declare in its policies.

.. note::
   For the below list, let us consider the application's security context to be ``app_t`` (also called domain context).

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Namespace", "SELinux interface", "Arguments", "Usage"
   :widths:  10, 25, 25, 40

   "tel", "telux_allow_tel()", "domain context", "telux_allow_tel(app_t)"
   "data", "telux_allow_data()", "domain context", "telux_allow_data(app_t)"
   "audio", "telux_allow_audio()", "domain context", "telux_allow_audio(app_t)"
   "loc", "telux_allow_loc()", "domain context", "telux_allow_loc(app_t)"
   "thermal", "telux_allow_thermalmanager()", "domain context", "telux_allow_thermalmanager(app_t)"
   "power", "telux_allow_power()", "domain context", "telux_allow_power(app_t)"
   "config", "telux_allow_modemconfig()", "domain context", "telux_allow_modemconfig(app_t)"
   "cv2x", "telux_allow_v2x()", "domain context", "telux_allow_v2x(app_t)"
   "sensor", "telux_allow_sensor()", "domain context", "telux_allow_sensor(app_t)"
   "platform", "telux_allow_platform()", "domain context", "telux_allow_platform(app_t)"
   "satcom", "telux_allow_satcom()", "domain context", "telux_allow_satcom(app_t)"

The following example illustrates how an application can incorporate the SELinux interfaces exposed by SDK in its SELinux policies. Below code snippet is part of a Type Enforcement (TE) file of the application which grants required permissions to perform SDK data operations.

.. code-block:: cpp

   policy_module(application, 1.0)
   type app_t;

   #Granting SDK data client permissions to the application

   telux_allow_data(app_t);

In addition to the above SELinux interfaces list, below are the SELinux interfaces specific to a usecase. When an app needs to use any API, it should
identify which SELinux interface to be used corresponding to the permission type and add it to the policy file.

To determine which permission type to be used for a API, please refer to the documentation for the API in the API Reference or in the API header file

.. note::
   The system integrator has the option to turn on/off this feature, where APIs related to a particular use case require certain permissions. If this feature is turned off, the use case specific permissions are not required by the caller.

The following example illustrates how to declare permissions for an application that wants to use :cpp:func:`telux::data::IDataConnectionManager::startDataCall` to setup a cellular data connection.The documentation of this API indicates
that the caller needs to have TELUX_DATA_CALL_OPS permission. The SELinux interface to be used is **telux_allow_data_call_ops**.

In order for the app to use the API the below code snippet needs to be entered in the Type Enforcement (TE) file of the application.

.. code-block:: cpp

   policy_module(application, 1.0)
   type app_t;

   #Allow data call operations

   telux_allow_data_call_ops(app_t)
