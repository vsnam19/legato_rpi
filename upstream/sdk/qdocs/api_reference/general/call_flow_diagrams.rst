Call Flow Diagrams
==================

Application initialization call flow
------------------------------------

Telematics-SDK initializes various sub-systems during start-up. It marks each sub-system's service status as SERVICE_AVAILABLE once the initialization procedures are completed for that sub-system. The application should pass callback function when requesting for manager object. This callback is invoked by underlying library which provides subsystem initialisation status.
The application has to wait until the corresponding sub-system callback is invoked. Application should make API requests when service status is SERVICE_AVAILABLE. Telematics-SDK provides APIs to fetch sub-system status.

Example:

Phone manager initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /../images/phone_initialization_call_flow.png

1. Application uses PhoneFactory to call getPhoneManager by providing application callback function as parameter.
2. The application recieves IPhoneManager.
3. Application requests for serviceStatus from IPhoneManager.
4. Application waits for the subsystem initialization callback, which notifies the subsystem initialization status.

Start TCP keep alive offload to modem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /../images/data_start_tcp_keep_alive.png

1. Application initiates the process by requesting the Keep Alive Manager instance from ``DataFactory`` using ``getKeepAliveManager(slotId, clientCallback)``. ``DataFactory`` responds with an instance of ``IKeepAliveManager``.
2. If ``IKeepAliveManager`` is not null, the application should wait for initialization to complete, i.e., ``clientCallback`` should be called with service status as ``AVAILABLE``.
3. Once ready, the application registers a listener using ``registerListener(IKeepAliveListener)``. Precondition Checks, the application ensures that; The data call has started. The TCP socket connection (required for offloading keep-alive to the modem) is established.
4. If operating in Monitor Mode, TCP session info (e.g., sequence numbers) is not needed. The application calls ``enableTCPMonitor()`` with input parameters.
5. The application receives ``monitorHandle`` and ``ErrorCode``. If successful At least one packet must be exchanged between the TCP client and server after calling ``enableTCPMonitor()`` for the modem to learn the TCP session parameters. The modem must learn these parameters before ``startTCPKeepAliveOffload()`` is called with ``monitorHandle``. For example, consider an application on a UE that uses MQTT over TCP to communicate with the cloud. After entering Monitor Mode, the client can either send a dummy PUBLISH message or resend a previous PUBLISH with the same topic. This ensures the modem receives a TCP packet after Monitor Mode is initiated. The application waits sufficiently for the sample packet to be acknowledged (e.g., ``tcpi_unacked`` becomes 0).
6. The application starts the keep-alive offload using ``startTCPKeepAliveOffload()`` with ``monitorHandle`` and ``interval``. The keep-alive interval is expected to be ≥ 60,000 milliseconds.
7. The modem returns ``tcpKAOffloadHandle`` and ``ErrorCode``.
8. If operating in Default Mode, TCP session info (e.g., sequence numbers) is required. The application calls ``startTCPKeepAliveOffload()`` with ``tcpKaParams``, ``tcpSessionParams``, and ``interval``. The keep-alive interval is expected to be ≥ 60,000 milliseconds.
9. The modem returns ``tcpKAOffloadHandle`` and ``ErrorCode``. Once offload is started, TCP keep-alive messages are sent by the modem at the configured interval. This continues even if the device enters suspend mode.
10. Any TCP packet transfer over the same session results in failure or stopping of the keep-alive offload. The application is notified via ``onKeepAliveStatusChange(NETWORK_ERR, tcpKAOffloadHandle)`` from ``IKeepAliveListener``.

This call flow diagram describes the sequence of steps for registering or deregistering C-V2X Rx flows using C++ version APIs.
Application must perform C-V2X radio initialization before calling any methods of ICv2xRadio.

There are three Rx modes supported for non-IP traffic,
- Wildcard Rx: Receive all service IDs on a single port. This mode could break catchall Rx and specific service ID Rx.
- Catchall Rx: Receive the specified service IDs on a single port. This mode can be used for Rx-only devices for which no Tx flow need to be created.
- Specific service ID Rx: Receive a specified service ID on a single port. Application can receive different service IDs on different ports by registering a pair of Tx and Rx flows for each service ID.

.. note::
  For catchall or specific service ID Rx mode, filtering for received broadcast packets is implemented in low layer based on the service ID and its mapped destination L2 address, assuming that each service ID is mapped to a unique destination L2 address for all Tx and Rx devices. If this assumption is not valid, for example, in ETSI standards all broadcast service IDs are using same destination L2 address 0xFFFFFFFF, then application should choose wildcard Rx method and do filtering in application layer.

8. Application receives synchronous status (either SUCCESS or FAILED) indicating whether the request for creating Tx flow was sent successfully.
9. C-V2X radio sends asynchronous notification via the callback function on the status of creating Tx flow. If SUCCESS, the TX event flow is returned in the callback.

1. Application requests to register a listener for Tx status report, providing the interested port number(portA) of Tx status reports and the listener for receiving the reports. C-V2X radio enables Tx status report in low layer if it is the first request for registering Tx status report.
2. Application receives synchronous status (either SUCCESS or FAILED) indicating whether the request was performed successfully.
3. Tx status report is generated for each transport block transmitted, the portB included in Tx status report indicates which source port the specific transport block is sent from, it can be used to associate the Tx status report with a Tx SPS/Event flow. C-V2X radio filters received Tx status reports based on the port of the listener (portA) and the port included in Tx status report (portB):

   - If portA is 0, no filtering to the Tx status reports, application gets Tx status reports for all transport blocks.
   - If portA is not 0 and it equals to portB, application only gets Tx status reports for transport blocks being sent from the specified port.
   - In other cases, Tx status reports are not sent to application.

4. Application deregister listener for Tx status report. If it is the last listener for Tx status report in the system, C-V2X radio disables Tx status report in low layer.
5. Application receives synchronous status (either SUCCESS or FAILED) indicating whether the request was performed successfully.

shutdown modes and its management service status. Also there is provision to set the desired
thermal auto-shutdown mode.

When application is notifed of service being unavailable, the thermal auto-shutdown mode updates
are inactive. After service becomes available, the existing listener registrations will be
maintained.

TCU Activity Management
-----------------------

An application can get the appropriate TCU-activity manager (i.e. slave or master) object from the power factory.
The TCU-activity manager configured as the master is responsible for triggering state transitions.
TCU-activity manager configured as a slave is responsible for listening to state change indications and acknowledging when it performs necessary tasks and prepares for the state transition.
A machine in this power management framework represents an application processor subsystem or a host/guest virtual machine on hypervisor based platforms.

- Only one master is allowed in the system, and currently we only support allowing the master on the primary/host machine and not on the guest virtual machine.
- It is expected that all processes interested in a TCU-activity state change should register as slaves.
- When the master changes the TCU-activate state, slaves connected to the impacted machine are notified.
- Master can trigger the TCU-activity state change of a specific machine or all machines at once.
- If the slave wants to differentiate between a state change indication that is the result of a trigger for all machines or a trigger for its specific machines, it can be detected using the machine name provided in the listener API.
- When the master triggers an all machines TCU-activity state change, only the machines that are not in the desired state will undergo the state transition, and the slaves to those machines will be notified.
- In the case of 

  - suspend or shutdown trigger: 

    - After becoming ready for state change, all slave clients should acknowledge back.
      - The master client will get notification about the consolidated acknowledgement status of all slave clients.
      - On getting a successful consolidated acknowledgement from all the slaves for the suspend trigger, the power framework allows the respective machine to suspend. On getting a successful consolidated acknowledgement from all the slaves for the shutdown trigger, the power framework triggers the respective machine shutdown without waiting further.
      - If the slave client sends a NACK to indicate that it is not ready for state transition or fails to acknowledge before the configured time, then the master will get to know via a consolidated acknowledgement / slave acknowledgement status notification.
      - In such failed cases, if the master wants to stop the state transition considering the information in the consolidated acknowledgement, then the master is allowed to trigger a new TCU-activity state change, or else the state transition will proceed after the configured timeout.

   - resume trigger:

      - Power framework will prevent the respective machine from going into suspend.
      - No acknowledgement will be required from slave clients and the master will not be getting consolidated acknowledgement / slave acknowledgement as machine will be already resumed. 

 When the application is notified about the service being unavailable, the TCU-activity state notifications will be inactive. After the service becomes available, the existing listener registrations will be maintained.


Call flow to register/remove listener for TCU-activity manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /../images/tcuactivity_manager_listener_callflow.png

1. Application requests power factory for TCU-activity manager object, with clientType as slave. slave clients set up to listen to their LOCAL_MACHINE. Also, it is recommended to give a unique name to each slave client so that client can be identified later in case of failure.
2. Power factory returns ITcuActivityManager object using which application will register or remove a listener.
3. Wait for the TCU-activity management services to be ready.
4. Application can register a listener for getting notifications on TCU-activity state updates on the machine. Some of the listener APIs are designed for slave clients and others for master clients. Listener APIs intended for the master client will not be sent to the slave client, and listner APIs intended for the slave client will not be sent for the master client.
5. Status of register listener i.e. either SUCCESS or FAILED will be returned to the application.
6. Application will get TCU-activity state notifications like suspend, resume and shutdown.
7. Application will send one acknowledgement, after processing(save any required information) suspend/shutdown notifications. This indicates the readiness of application for state-transition. However the TCU-activity management service doesn't wait for acknowledgement indefinitely, before performing the state transition. In the acknowledgement, slave can specify the machine name received in the notification in the previous step.
8. Application receives synchronous status which indicates if the acknowledgement was sent successfully.
9. Application can remove listener.
10. Status of remove listener i.e. either SUCCESS or FAILED will be returned to the application.

Sensor
------

The sensor sub-system provides APIs to configure and acquire continuous stream of data from an
underlying sensor, create multiple clients for a given sensor, each of which can have their own
configuration (sampling rate, batch count) for data acquisition.

The sensor sub-system APIs are synchronous in nature.

Call flow for sensor sub-system start-up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /../images/sensor_subsystem_startup_call_flow.png

1. Get the reference to the SensorFactory, with which we can further acquire other sensor sub-system
   objects.
2. Prepare an initialization callback method or lambda which will be called by the sensor sub-system
   once the initialization is complete.
3. Request for the SensorManager from SensorFactory and provide the initalization callback. Retain
   the SensorManager shared_ptr as long as necessary. SensorFactory does not hold on to the returned
   instance. If the received shared_ptr is released, SensorManager would be destroyed and requesting
   SensorFactory for SensorManager again would result in the creation of a new instance. Similar is the
   approach for SensorFeatureManager.
4. Wait for the initialization callback to be invoked.
5. The sensor sub-system invokes the callback once the underlying sub-system and sensor framework is
   available for usage. If the service status is notified as SERVICE_FAILED, retry intitialization
   starting with step (3). If the service status is notified as SERVICE_AVAILABLE, the sensor
   sub-system is ready for usage.

Call flow for sensor data acquisition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /../images/sensor_data_acquisition_call_flow.png

The sensor sub-system should have been initialized successfully with SERVICE_AVAILABLE as a
pre-requisite for sensor data acquisition and a valid SensorManager object is available.

1. Get the information about available sensors from ISensorManager. The information will be provided
   in the sensorInfo parameter that would be passed by reference.
2. Given the information about different sensors, identify the required sensor (name of the sensor)
   using the provided attributes - type, name, vendor or required sampling frequency. Having identified the required sensor,
   request for the sensor object from ISensorManager with the required name of the sensor. If the request
   was successful, the provided reference to shared_ptr<ISensorClient> would be set by the ISensorManager
   which can be used to further configure and acquire data from the sensor. The ownership of the
   sensor object is with the application. SensorManager does not hold a reference to the returned
   instance. So, requesting ISensorManager for a sensor with the same name would result in a new
   sensor object being returned.
3. Create a listener of type ISensorEventListener which would receive notifications about updates
   to sensor configuration and sensor events. Register the created listener with the sensor object.
4. Create the desired sensor configuration. For continous data acquisition samplingRate and
   batchCount are necessary attributes to be set in the configuration. Be sure to set the validityMask
   in the SensorConfiguration structure.
5. On successful configuration, a notification is sent to the registered listeners indicating the
   configuration set.
6. Activate the sensor for acquiring sensor data.
7. When the sensor is activated successfully, the sensor data is sent to the registered listeners.

Call flow for sensor reconfiguration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /../images/sensor_reconfiguration_call_flow.png

When the sensor sub-system has been initialized successfully with SERVICE_AVAILABLE and is already
activated, reconfiguring the sensors involves the following steps.

1. Deactivate the sensor. This will stop the notifications about sensor events to the registered
   listeners.
2. Configure the sensor with the required attributes. Be sure to set the validityMask for the all
   required attributes in SensorConfiguration.
3. The underlying sub-system notifies the registered listeners about the new configuration set.
4. Activate the sensor.
5. When the sensor is activated successfully, the sensor data is sent to the registered listeners
   as per the new configuration.

Call flow for sensor sub-system cleanup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /../images/sensor_subsystem_cleanup_call_flow.png

When the sensor sub-system has been initialized successfully with SERVICE_AVAILABLE and sensor
objects have been created, the following steps ensure a cleanup of the sensor sub-system.

1. Deactivate all the sensors. With this, the registered listeners will no longer be notified of the
   sensor events.
2. Release all the sensor objects created by setting them to nullptr. Since the application owns the
   objects, this would result in all the sensor objects getting destroyed.
3. Disable all the sensor features that were previously enabled.
4. Release the instance of ISensorManager by setting it to nullptr. Since the application owns the
   object, this would result in the sensor manager getting destroyed.
5. Release the instance of ISensorFeatureManager by setting it to nullptr. Since the application
   owns the object, this would result in the sensor feature manager getting destroyed.

Call flow for sensor power control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /../images/sensor_power_control_call_flow.png

The below points are to be noted for sensor power control

a) Power control is not offered by all sensor manufacturers. If the underlying hardware sensor does
not support power control, the power control APIs fail.
b) Enabling or disabling low power mode for the sensor is only possible when the sensor is not
activated.

For achieving power control, the following steps are to be followed

1. Deactivate the sensor. This will stop the notifications about sensor events to the registered
   listeners.
2. Perform the required power control by enabling or disabling low power mode for the sensor.
3. Activate the sensor.
4. When the sensor is activated successfully, the sensor data is sent to the registered listeners.

Call flow for sensor feature control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /../images/sensor_feature_control_call_flow.png

The sensor sub-system offers certain features in addition to the data acquisition and these could be
features offered by the underlying sensor hardware or the sensor software framework. If there are no
features offered collectively, the sensor feature manager initialization would fail.

1. Retrieve a list of features offered by the sensor sub-system and identify the required feature
   that needs to be enabled. If the feature that needs to be enabled is known, this step is optional.
2. Create a sensor feature event listener, which would be notified of the different events that
   occur. Register this listener with the sensor feature manager.
3. Enable the required feature.
4. If system is not in sleep mode, Once the feature is enabled and an event related to the feature occurs, the listener is notified.
5. If system is in sleep mode, Once the feature is enabled and an event related to the feature occurs, the listener is notified.

Platform
--------

The platform sub-system provides APIs to configure and control platform functionalities.
This sub-system provides notifications about certain system related events, for instance filesystem
events such as EFS restore and backup events.

Call flow for EFS restore notification registration and handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /../images/platform_efs_backup_restore_call_flow.png

1. Get the reference to the PlatformFactory, with which we can further acquire other sub-system
   objects.
2. Prepare an initialization callback method or lambda which will be called by the platform
   sub-system once the initialization is complete.
3. Request for the IFsManager (filesystem manager) object from PlatformFactory and provide the
   initalization callback. Retain the IFsManager shared_ptr as long as necessary. PlatformFactory does
   not hold on to the returned instance. If the received shared_ptr is released, FsManager would be
   destroyed and requesting PlatformFactory for FsManager again would result in the creation of a new
   instance.
4. Wait for the initialization callback to be invoked. The platform sub-system invokes the callback
   once the underlying sub-system is available for usage. If the service status is notified as
   SERVICE_FAILED, retry intitialization starting with step (3). If the service status is notified as
   SERVICE_AVAILABLE, the filesystem manager is ready for usage.
5. Create an listener object of type IFsListener and register with IFsManager for notifications.
   Once registered, the listener receives service status notifications and EFS restore event
   notifications.
6. If a service status notification with status SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, the application should wait
   for service to be re-initialized and once done, SERVICE_AVAILABLE will be notified. If the service
   fails, SERVICE_FAILED is notified and the IFsManager object held is no longer usable. A new object
   of type IFsManager needs to be re-acquired from the PlatformFactory.
7. When the application finds it appropriate to trigger a EFS backup, startEfsBackup should be
   invoked, which would return immediately indicating the status of the request
8. Once EFS backup starts and completes, the notifications are sent out to the application.
   EFS restoration is controlled by the internal components based on several factors like
   identification of critical filesystem errors which result in failure to boot. When such conditions
   are identified, EFS restore events would be received by the application via the OnEfsRestoreEvent
   method and the application can make use of the information appropriately. The EFS restore
   notification also has information if the restore started or ended and if the restore was successful
   or a failure.
9. Once clean-up is necessary, deregister the registered listener, set all shared pointers to
   nullptr. This will make the underlying sub-system relinquish resources that are no longer
   necessary.

Call flow of control filesystem for eCall operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /../images/control_filesystem_for_ecall_start_end_call_flow.png

The platform sub-system should have been initialized successfully with SERVICE_AVAILABLE as a
pre-requisite for any filesystem operations and a valid FilesystemManager object is available.

1. Before initiate an eCall, the application should prepare the filesystem for eCall operation,
   prepareForEcall should be invoked. If the status of this request fails, the client could re-invoke
   during an eCall ongoing.
2. The status of the request would return immediately indicating the preparation of the filesystem
   operation.
3. The client should start an eCall immediately even if the prepare for eCall request failed.
4. The filesystem manager shall notify the application when filesystem operation is about to resume.
5. If the client wants to suspend the filesystem operation to continue the eCall, they should invoke
   the prepareForEcall API.
6. Once an eCall completes, the client should notify eCall completion to the filesystem manager.
   eCallCompleted should be invoked.
7. The status of the request would return immediately indication the completion of the filesystem
   operation.

Call flow of control filesystem for OTA operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /../images/control_filesystem_for_ota_start_end_call_flow.png

The platform sub-system should have been initialized successfully with SERVICE_AVAILABLE as a
pre-requisite for any filesystem operations and a valid FilesystemManager object is available.

1. Before initiate an OTA update, the application should prepare the filesystem for the OTA
   operation, prepareForOta should be invoked, which would return immediately indicating the
   status of the request.
2. Once the filesystem has prepared for the OTA operation, the filesystem manager would invoke the
   callback which indicates the response of the API.
3. Once the filesystem has prepared for the OTA operation, the client could initiate an OTA update.
4. On OTA update completion, the client should notify the filesystem manager of the OTA
   completion status, otaCompleted should be invoked, which would return immediately indicating
   the status of the request.
5. The filesystem manager would intern update the OTA status, the callback would invoked
   which indicates the response of the API.
6. If the client decides to mirror the system, startAbSync should be invoked which would return
   immediately indicating the status of the request.
7. Once the filesystem partition sync opration complete, the filesystem manager would invoke the
   callback which indicates the response of the API.

Call flow for sensor self test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /../images/sensor_self_test_call_flow.png

Certain sensors offer self test feature which can be invoked whenever needed by the application
using the selfTest API. The sensor sub-system should have been initialized successfully with
SERVICE_AVAILABLE as a pre-requisite for sensor data acquisition and a valid SensorManager object
is available.

1. Get the information about available sensors from ISensorManager. The information will be provided
   in the sensorInfo parameter that would be passed by reference.
2. Given the information about different sensors, identify the required sensor (name of the sensor)
   using the provided attributes - type, name, vendor or required sampling frequency. Having identified the required sensor,
   request for the sensor object from ISensorManager with the required name of the sensor. If the request
   was successful, the provided reference to shared_ptr<ISensorClient> would be set by the ISensorManager
   which can be used to further configure and acquire data from the sensor. The ownership of the
   sensor object is with the application. SensorManager does not hold a reference to the returned
   instance. So, requesting ISensorManager for a sensor with the same name would result in a new
